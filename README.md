# Tournament Organizer
A desktop app that keeps track of players/teams and creates skill-determined brackets to help run 5v5 game tournaments.

To use, the Tournament Organizer and Database file must be in the same directory since Database uses text files to store data. 
The user should first add at least one tournament instance which they can populate with teams and players. The user may enter
information about these players and teams. They are sorted alphabetically (not lexicographically) by their names but can be 
searched if needed. Once enough teams are added, brackets are automatically formed and visualized on the client. Lower ranked 
teams are matched with higher ranked teams as to direct the best teams to the finals. When the user is finished entering necessary data,
they may start the tournament and document the result of each match until a winner is produced at the top of the bracket.
